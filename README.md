## Tech

Fund my Food bank uses the technologies listed below to fully function:

-   [ReactJS] - Frontend development.
-   [NextJS] - React framework for server side rendering.
-   [Prisma] - Open source ORM for the database.
-   [PostgreSQL] - Our database.

## How the subscription works

User selects the foodbank the would like to donate to from their local area.

-   A checkout session is created on the backend using the token from Stripe.
-   The token is passed to the frontend which redirects to stripe payment gateway.

```
    const accountLink = await stripe.accountLinks.create({
        account: 'acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C',
        refresh_url: 'https://example.com/reauth',
        return_url: 'https://example.com/return',
        type: 'account_onboarding',
        });
```

-   When the stripe flow is finished an email is sent to the foodbank.
-   Donor is redirected to payment success page.
